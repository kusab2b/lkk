    <h1><b><del>What is Lorem ipsum?</del></b></h1> <br>
    <img src="./AA 1.png" width="238.5px" height="185px">
    <p><b>Lorem ipsum</b> is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the
        industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown <br><i>printer took a galley of type and
            scrambled
            it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic
            typesetting, remaining <br>essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the <mark><u>1960s</u></mark> with
            the release of Letraset
            sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software <br>like Aldus
            PageMaker
            including versions of</i> <b>Lorem Ipsum.</b></p>
    <p><b>.There are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum available, but the majority have suffered alteration in
            some form, by injected humour, or randomised words which don't <br>look even slightly believable. If you are
            going to use a passage of Lorem Ipsum, you need to be sure there isn't anything embarrassing hidden in the
            middle of text. “All the <br>Lorem Ipsum generators on the Internet tend to repeat predefined chunks as
            necessary, making this the first true generator on the Internet“. It uses a dictionary of over 200 <br>Latin
            words, combined with a handful of model sentence structures, to generate Lorem Ipsum which looks reasonable.
            <i>The generated Lorem Ipsum is therefore always free <br>from repetition, injected humour, or non-characteristic
            words etc.</i></b></p>
